# Tips for time traveling to the future
Unfortunately Coingecko.com doesn't share with us information about bitcoin prices in the future, even if you subscribe to Pro-API Plan, or maybe they just don't have their own time machine. However there is still a possibility to make a profit from the future. You need to go to the nearest future (because there is no guarantee that in the far future there will be the same technologies and this App will work). For example now it is December 2021, you should jump to February 2022, go to the Bitcoin App web page, search for January results (and the results will be there, as January is already a past relative to February). Choose the best days to make a profit, go to January, buy bitcoins, sell bitcoins and return back to nowadays! Simple!
